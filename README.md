# Score Keeper

version: 1.0.0

## Deployed on Azure

## Summary

I wrote this app because my partner and I play Rummy all of the time and there isn't always a sheet of paper around to keep score.  This not only solves that problem but also keeps track of each player's overall wins.

## Usage

+ **Score Sheet**
  + Enter each round's scores into the input fields and press the + button.
