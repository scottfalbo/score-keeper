# Score Keeper

version: 1.0.0

## Deployed on Azure

[ScoreKeeper]()

---

## Summary

I wrote this app because my partner and I play Rummy all of the time and there isn't always a sheet of paper around to keep score.  This not only solves that problem but also keeps track of each player's over all wins.
